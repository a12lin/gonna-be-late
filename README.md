# Gonna Be Late

Got a social obligation to go to, but just don't wanna? Instead of coming up with an excuse that sounds as fake as it really is, simply type the location of your social obligation into the **Gonna Be Late** app, and get back some actually believable excuses you can use - believable because they're based on real things, like real-time traffic delays. 

So next time you decide to show up late or show up never, use **Gonna Be Late** to make it seem like you really tried to make it on time.

> On a more serious note, you can also use **Gonna Be Late** to explore nearby traffic status and popular events, as well as trending news and BART alerts.

## What's next

**Gonna Be Late** v.1 can do a lot, but it can't do everything. I'd like for v.2 to include the following improvements:
* Pull the status of local public transit, including in cities beyond the Bay Area.
* Allow users to share out an excuse via text or Facebook.
